description: >
  Design and implement distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces with a
  strong aesthetic point-of-view. This skill prioritizes originality, visual
  craft, and intentional design decisions while avoiding generic or template-like
  UI patterns.

use_when:
  - Building websites, landing pages, dashboards, or web applications
  - Creating or styling React/Vue components, HTML/CSS layouts, or design artifacts
  - Beautifying, redesigning, or visually elevating existing frontend UI
  - Producing posters, marketing pages, or brand-driven digital interfaces

do_not_use_when:
  - Backend-only logic or API implementation
  - Pure algorithmic or data-processing tasks
  - Documentation-only or text-only outputs

inputs:
  required:
    - frontend requirements (component, page, or application description)
  optional:
    - target audience
    - brand guidelines
    - technical constraints (framework, performance, accessibility)
    - platform context (web, mobile web, embedded, kiosk)

outputs:
  - Fully functional frontend code (HTML/CSS/JS or framework-based)
  - Visually cohesive and production-ready UI implementation
  - Clear aesthetic direction consistently executed across the interface

# Skill: frontend-design

## Objective
Create **memorable, high-quality frontend interfaces** that feel intentionally
designed for their context. Every output must demonstrate strong visual judgment,
technical correctness, and a clear aesthetic identity.

Generic, templated, or “AI-looking” UI is unacceptable.

---

## Design Thinking Process

Before writing any code:

1. **Purpose**
   - What problem does the interface solve?
   - Who is the primary user?
   - What emotional response should the UI evoke?

2. **Aesthetic Direction**
   - Select a **bold, explicit design flavor** (e.g. brutalist, editorial,
     retro-futuristic, organic, luxury, industrial, playful, art deco, minimalist).
   - Commit fully. Avoid blending multiple styles without intent.

3. **Constraints**
   - Respect framework, performance, accessibility, and platform requirements.
   - Accessibility is mandatory; aesthetics must not break usability.

4. **Differentiation**
   - Identify one defining visual or interaction concept that makes the interface
     unforgettable.
   - Design everything in service of this concept.

> CRITICAL RULE: Intentionality over intensity.  
> A restrained design must be precise; a maximalist design must be disciplined.

## Implementation Standards

All generated code must be:

- Production-grade and functional
- Cohesive with the chosen aesthetic direction
- Clean, readable, and maintainable
- Free from placeholder visuals or vague styling

## Frontend Aesthetic Guidelines

### Typography
- Use **distinctive, characterful fonts**
- Avoid generic defaults (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts)
- Pair a strong display font with a refined body font
- Pay attention to hierarchy, spacing, and rhythm

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive palette
- Use CSS variables or theme tokens
- Prefer dominant colors with intentional accents
- Avoid timid, evenly-distributed color usage

### Motion & Interaction
- Use motion to reinforce hierarchy and delight
- Prefer CSS animations where possible
- For React, use a motion library when appropriate
- Focus on high-impact moments:
  - Page load reveals
  - Section transitions
  - Intentional hover states
- Avoid random or excessive micro-interactions

### Spatial Composition
- Embrace:
  - Asymmetry
  - Overlap
  - Grid-breaking elements
  - Diagonal or editorial flow
- Use negative space or dense layouts intentionally
- Avoid predictable component stacking

### Backgrounds & Visual Detail
- Create atmosphere and depth
- Use:
  - Gradient meshes
  - Noise or grain textures
  - Layered transparencies
  - Dramatic shadows
  - Decorative borders or patterns
- Backgrounds must support the aesthetic concept, not distract

---

## Explicit Prohibitions

NEVER:
- Use generic AI aesthetics
- Default to common UI kits or boilerplate layouts
- Reuse the same fonts, palettes, or visual patterns across unrelated designs
- Use cliché color schemes (e.g. purple-on-white gradients)
- Produce context-agnostic or brandless UI

Each design must feel **custom-built for its purpose**.

---

## Complexity Alignment Rule

- **Maximalist designs** → rich animations, layered visuals, complex layouts
- **Minimalist designs** → restraint, typography precision, subtle spacing control

Elegance is achieved through **execution quality**, not feature count.

## Brand Guidelines (Applicable for this workspace)

### Colors
- #03518b
- #60923f
- #c8da2d
- #ffffff

### Typography
- Titles: Radnika Next — Bold
- Body Text: Avenir — Normal / Roman

---

## Final Principle
Design like a human with taste, not a system chasing averages.  
Every interface should feel intentional, crafted, and worth remembering.
